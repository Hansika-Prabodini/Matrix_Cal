# Matrix Calculation App

**Matrix Calculation App** is a small, portable collection of documentation files for a matrix calculation application (desktop, web, or CLI).  
These markdown files explain setup, usage, API, examples, contribution guidelines, and licensing — ready to include in your project repository.

## Features
- Basic matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication
- Advanced operations: determinant, inverse, transpose, rank
- Utilities: Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, eigenvalues (optional)
- Simple CLI and library-friendly API (language-agnostic documentation)
- Example usage & step-by-step walkthroughs

## Repository contents (this docs package)
- `INSTALLATION.md` — how to install dependencies and run the app
- `USAGE.md` — how to use the app (CLI and library examples)
- `API.md` — function signatures and behavior for library usage
- `EXAMPLES.md` — worked examples and sample matrices
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — how to contribute and run tests
- `LICENSE.md` — license template
- `CHANGELOG.md` — change history notes

## Quick start
1. Read `INSTALLATION.md` to set up your environment.
2. See `USAGE.md` for example commands and library usage.
3. Try examples in `EXAMPLES.md`.

If you'd like, I can also generate language-specific code files (Python/JavaScript) and tests. Just tell me which language you prefer.
